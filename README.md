# sparta-js-XO
You challenge is build the game TicTacToe in the browser using JQuery. We will give you the html layout for the game. We will need you to use what you have learnt so far with selecting things with JQuery and creating event listeners with JQuery to create this game.

Your deliverables:-

1) Git repo with Dev and Master branches
2) Me and Joe added as contributors
3) Finished README.md with brief, what went well, the challenges and list of what you delivered
4) pull-request submitted by 9:00am tomorrow
5) The game should display the correct 'X' or 'Y' for each button pressed in the browser
6) Once a tile has been clicked it should not be able to be clicked again
7) The clear button should clear the board
8) When a winning condition is present you should display a winner, either X or Y
9) The program should use functions, loops, JQuery selectors and JQuery events

## What went (sort of) well

I was able to make each box repsond to a click easily, but the clicks would either input both an X and O or only one but never the other i.e. all boxes filled with X or O

## Difficulties

The alternating turn function was difficult to implement.
I tried a true/false statement but an increment statment was actually easier to follow.
But hey still dont work
